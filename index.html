His books exhaustively compile and collate nearly every Eastern and Western modality for personal and spiritual growth.

If you haven’t been exposed to Crowley before (outside of his image), you’ll be shocked at the clarity of his insight and wit, along with the range of his technical knowledge. Crowley’s system took the Golden Dawn material, added in Eastern mysticism and sex magick, and ratcheted the whole thing up to the tenth power. Don't get lost in Crowley's personality or often-disturbing biography—what's important is the techniques. Alongside this, you’ll likely want a copy of the equally important <em>Gems From the Equinox.</em></p>

You’ll recognize the clear inspiration not only for The Matrix but a huge swathe of pop culture that came after this comic, which seemed like a truly “alien” transmission in the 1990s. (Morrison claimed that the comic book was his attempt to express information given to him when he was abducted by aliens in Kathmandu.) <strong>Caveat:</strong> Find the letters columns! These were in the individual issues and featured Grant talking about his personal occult experiences that prompted the series. They’re not in the reprint book, but Google will turn them up. </p>

Look, it's a must. It'll light up the sometimes dry material you can find in Crowley and the Golden Dawn and help you just get it.

                <p>You don't need to sink a ton of money into a temple setup and ritual tools to get started. In fact, this can even be a distraction—as in, <em>Oh, I'll do some magic as soon as I get a few more tools...</em> All you truly need to do magick is your Will & Imagination. That said, setting up temple space is important. But you should start small, and start practicing now—you can always upgrade your gear later. Here's a few basic items to get you started.</p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I1-copy" class="item__info__copy"> You need a meditation cushion that you’ll want to sit on with a straight (and unsupported) back, day in and day out. Chairs are no good, and laying down will lead to sleep. You need a zen-style cushion. A folded up blanket can work. The Zafu cushion, which comes in several colors, is specifically designed for meditation, offers great support and is quite versatile.</p>

It allows one to assume Dragon Asana, or Zen-style meditation, fairly easily—and also facilitates the practice of pranayama and even more complex asanas and practices. I got one of these at the much-missed Bodhi Tree Bookstore in Los Angeles many years ago—it was one of the most worthwhile purchases of my life. One note: Mine doesn't have the cushioning that has apparently been added to this model, but I do tend to cushion mine with a blanket anyway. </p>

A folded blanket or two will work, too. (Note: I haven't tried the specific model linked here, but have used others extensively in Buddhist meditation centers.)</p>
                        <p><em>NOTE:</em> Meditation padding and props are a matter of personal preference. You don't necessarily need to get everything listed above—just what makes you most comfortable.</p>

Not only is this method portable, but you can pack it up and move it easily if you live with people who might be confused by what you’re doing. Check out this durable red paracord. It’s sturdy—and red, the color of Mars, the planet of establishing and guarding boundaries.</p>

                <p>Once you get settled into a good routine, and learning more classical magical theory in the Magick.Me courses, you will likely want to start adding some of the classic magical tools. Here's a few recommendations for some simple and easy representations of the classic magical tools.</p>

                        <p data-lead-id="S3I5-copy" class="item__info__copy">Finding an easy starter altar turns out to be a phenomenally hard task for some reason. Traditionally, the altar is meant to be a double cube, the dimensions of which are determined by the height of the individual magician. (See <em>Book 4</em>, linked above.) That takes custom woodworking, and that's expensive and time consuming. To make things easier to start with, this is the absolute best off-the-shelf altar I've found—and I actually looked for years before I found something so seemingly simple. These are often sold at Target stores in the United States. You can cover the openings with an altar cloth in order to make a closed altar. It's also low enough to act as a good meditation focus while sitting. An all-around excellent basic buy.</p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I6-copy" class="item__info__copy">Oil is traditionally used to purify and consecrate both your tools and yourself. It represents the pure aspiration of the magician. You can rub it into your tools to keep them sparkling and rust-free, and you can also use it to "light up" your chakras by dabbing a bit on each location. The classic blend is Abramelin Oil—this is a good blend, made by serious practitioners. </p>
                        <p><em>NOTE:</em> Be very careful in handling this and do not get this in your eyes, whatever you do! It's not toxic, but it contains cinnamon oil and will burn.</p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I7-copy" class="item__info__copy">These are the Pentacle (Earth), Dagger (Air), Cup (Water) and Wand (Fire). Building and consecrating these tools is a critical part of any magician's training, and an immensely personal task—however, doing this properly can take years. In the meantime, it doesn't hurt to have off-the-shelf stand-in items on your altar to start using in your magick. I've listed some great, inexpensive (and even Qabalistically appropriate) starter tools here: Pentacle, Dagger, Cup and Wand. </p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I8-copy" class="item__info__copy">A simple black robe is all that is required for ritual work. With regular use, it can provide a potent trigger for altered states, allowing you to assume "magical consciousness" when you don it. This is a high-quality black kimono, similar to the classic "Tau robe," that will work just fine as a starter robe.</p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I9-copy" class="item__info__copy">A good bell is used to mark the beginning and ending of rituals, and can be used to strike specific notes within ritual as well. The word "bell" is a bit misleading, however: What you ideally want is tingsha, which are small Tibetan-style cymbals on a cord that you strike together. They sound better, look cooler and are easier to control. This pair works great.</p>

						<p data-lead-id="S3I10-copy" class="item__info__copy">As your ceremonies progress, you'll want to build up a retinue of different incenses. While it's OK to start with stick incense, you'll want to graduate to getting an open incense burner, which uses special charcoal and raw incense grains. You can get a burner here, charcoal here and some basic Frankincense, a good incense to start with for your early spiritually purificatory work, here.</p>
                        <p><em>NOTE:</em> To operate, you hold the edge of the charcoal up to a flame until sparks begin to run through it, and then you place it in the burner. After it stops sparking, you can place incense kernels on top. But note carefully: The burner will get <em>extremely</em> hot. For this reason, don't place it on plastic or anything flammable, be very careful about touching it, and don't leave it unattended. </p>
